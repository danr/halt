   Trims away unnecessary function definitions from the theory.

   TODO:

      * Do this for data types as well. Problem: need to find
        a good way to find all used data types in a function.

      * Do something similar for function pointers. For every function
        we decide to use, add its necessary function pointers.

-- | Given a set of variables, removes all function definitions that

--   We make a graph. Every recursive group defines some functions fs
--   and depends on some functions ds. Make an arrow from fs to each ds.
--   In the end, we follow all arrows from our initial variables.
--
--   We have keys as Var:s, and nodes are just dummy ().
--   Afterwards, we filter out those function definitions that do not
--   correspond to any interesting Var:s.
